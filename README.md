# Ruby-Practice
Simple practice projects for Odin Project. Mostly small Ruby programs, algorithms, etc.

The goal of this repo is to keep my Ruby work in one place, and to see my progress.

## July 7

Been learning Ruby for a few weeks. Starting to pick up a little steam, growing familiar with object methods, etc. Right now I'm using CodeEval and the Odin Project.
